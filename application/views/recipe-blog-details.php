		<p>With so much talk of fitness going around in the world, people are
			looking at high protein, low carb diets, and also trying multitudes
			of fitness regimes. Everyday, we see people around us trying to go
			the extra mile to be fit on the outside, but not many are trying to
			be fit on the inside. We at Alpino believe that fitness begins with
			what one puts inside their body. Only by eating healthy, can one be
			truly fit! The right path to a good looking body is to both exercise
			and eat some essential foods that can help with bodily functions.
			Here is a list of super foods that everyone should include in their
			diet!</p>

		<h4>BROCCOLI</h4>
		<p>Related to the cauliflower and kale family, Broccoli is very
			beneficial in terms of nutrients and is referred to as the ‘super
			veggie’. Broccoli is rich in nutrients like fiber, Vitamin K, C,
			Iron, and Potassium. It can be enjoyed both raw and cooked. However,
			it is always advised to steam the vegetables once before consuming.</p>
